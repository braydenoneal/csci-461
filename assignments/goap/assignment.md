# Goal Oriented Action Planner

Download the GOAP Download GOAP Python files. You are to make two enhancements:

1. The program currently selects a single goal and searches for any set of actions that meet the goal. Improve the
   search to return an optimal -- or at least shorter -- result.
2. Make another enhancement. This could be adding times to the actions, changing the value of the goal, selecting
   actions first rather than goals, implementing actions using the Agent class you have built, or something else.

Part 1 is to deliver one of the two items above. (Part 2 will be to do the other one.) Most of you will want to start
with the improved search, but some enhancements may change the search procedure enough that it makes more sense in
the opposite order. Use your judgment.
